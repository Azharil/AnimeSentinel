# Anime-Sentinel
This project will (eventually) aim to create THE streaming site. Or at least provide links to other streaming sites whilst serving as a general search engine.
It will also focus on delivering notifications when new episodes come out so you never miss them again.

Features will include:
 - Integrate with MyAnimeList so it knows what you are watching.
 - Send you a mail or update to an RSS feed when a new episode for an anime you're watching becomes available.
 - Index which anime are streamed on which locations. Since this is A LOT of data, it must be done dynamically. As in, only start searching for relevant data once a user requests it, then store it forever.
 - Provide links to locations where a certain anime is streamed. Possibly stream those video's directly from this site.
